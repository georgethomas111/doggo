# Readme

Doggo http is a simple package that helps to read the details of the http going out or in from a network socket.
It should dump data for the visualizations to pick up. This data can be used to analyse the network better.
Idea is to have the ability to understand the protocol data better to figure out issues with a paticular interface.
